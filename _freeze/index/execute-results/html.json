For this, the following should work for most people.\n\nRun in R: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"keras\", dependencies = T)\nkeras::install_keras()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis should work on most computers, in particular if all software is recent. Sometimes, however, things don't work well, especially the python distribution often makes problems. If the installation does not work for you, we can look at it together. Also, we will provide some virtual machines in case your computers / laptops are too old or you don't manage to install TensorFlow.\n\n**Warning**: *You need at least TensorFlow version 2.6, otherwise, the argument \"learning_rate\" must be \"lr\"!*\n\n\n## Torch for R\n\nWe may also use Torch for R. This is an R frontend for the popular PyTorch framework. To install Torch, type in R:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"torch\")\nlibrary(torch)\ntorch::install_torch()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## EcoData\n\nWe may sometimes use data sets from the EcoData package. To install the package, run:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndevtools::install_github(repo = \"TheoreticalEcology/EcoData\", \n                         dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe default installation will install a number of packages that are useful for statistics. Especially in Linux, this may take some time to install. If you are in a hurry and only want the data, you can also run\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndevtools::install_github(repo = \"TheoreticalEcology/EcoData\", \n                         dependencies = FALSE, build_vignettes = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Further Used Libraries\n\nWe will make huge use of different libraries. So take a coffee or two (that will take a while...) and install the following libraries.\nPlease do this in the given order unless you know what you're doing, because there are some dependencies between the packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"abind\")\ninstall.packages(\"animation\")\ninstall.packages(\"ape\")\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\")\nBiocManager::install(c(\"Rgraphviz\", \"graph\", \"RBGL\"))\ninstall.packages(\"coro\")\ninstall.packages(\"dbscan\")\ninstall.packages(\"dendextend\")\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\ninstall.packages(\"e1071\")\ninstall.packages(\"factoextra\")\ninstall.packages(\"fields\")\ninstall.packages(\"forcats\")\ninstall.packages(\"glmnet\")\ninstall.packages(\"gym\")\ninstall.packages(\"kknn\")\ninstall.packages(\"knitr\")\ninstall.packages(\"iml\")\ninstall.packages(\"lavaan\")\ninstall.packages(\"lmtest\")\ninstall.packages(\"magick\")\ninstall.packages(\"mclust\")\ninstall.packages(\"Metrics\")\ninstall.packages(\"microbenchmark\")\ninstall.packages(\"missRanger\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlbench\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3learners\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3measures\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3pipelines\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3tuning\")\ninstall.packages(\"paradox\")\ninstall.packages(\"partykit\")\ninstall.packages(\"pcalg\")\ninstall.packages(\"piecewiseSEM\")\ninstall.packages(\"purrr\")\ninstall.packages(\"randomForest\")\ninstall.packages(\"ranger\")\ninstall.packages(\"rpart\")\ninstall.packages(\"rpart.plot\")\ninstall.packages(\"scales\")\ninstall.packages(\"semPlot\")\ninstall.packages(\"stringr\")\n#install.packages(\"tfprobability\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"torchvision\")\ninstall.packages(\"xgboost\")\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"andrie/deepviz\", dependencies = TRUE,\n                         upgrade = \"always\")\ndevtools::install_github('skinner927/reprtree')\ndevtools::install_version(\"lavaanPlot\", version = \"0.6.0\")\n\n# reticulate::conda_install(\"r-reticulate\", packages = \"scipy\", pip = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Linux/UNIX systems have to fulfill some further dependencies\n\n**Debian based systems**\n\nFor Debian based systems, we need:\n\n```{}\nbuild-essential\ngfortran\nlibmagick++-dev\nr-base-dev\n```\n\nIf you are new to installing packages on Debian / Ubuntu, etc., type the following:\n\n```{}\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install -y --install-recommends build-essential gfortran libmagick++-dev r-base-dev\n```\n\n## Apple M1/M2 users\nThose of you using Apple's new M1/M2 processors may encounter some difficulties when trying to install TensorFlow or Torch or at the same time. Also, the install instructions for TensorFlow and Torch differ depending on your version of R:\n\nRun in your R-terminal:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsessionInfo()$R.version$arch\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"aarch64\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n* \"x86_64\" means that you are using the x86_64 intel R version. For x86_64, you can install torch via ´install.packages('torch')´. But you __can't install keras and tensorflow__! So, for the course, either you always use torch (no worries, we provided torch code chunks everywhere as an alternative), or you use one of our virtual machine (where you can use R via rstudio-server in the browser)\n\n* \"aarch64\" means that you are using the (native) ARM R version. Here, it is difficult but possible to install Keras and TensorFlow, but __impossible to install torch__. So normally you would install first the R package keras via ´install.packages('torch')´ and then run ´kras::install_keras()´. The install_keras function downloads and installs the python dependencies in the background. However if you are using the R-ARM version you will need to install the python dependencies yourself. Here's a [guide](https://caffeinedev.medium.com/how-to-install-tensorflow-on-m1-mac-8e9b91d93706). \n\nSo in summary, it is difficult for M1/M2 users to get Keras and TensorFlow to work. I recommend either using the x86_64 version (since Torch installation is very easy) or using one of our virtual machines that successfully run Torch and TensorFlow/Keras. \n\n\n\n## Reminders About Basic Operations in R \n\nBasic and advanced knowledge of R is required to successfully participate in this course. If you would like to refresh your knowledge of R, you can review the chapter ['Reminder: R Basics'](https://theoreticalecology.github.io/AdvancedBiostatistics/reminder.html) from the advanced statistic course.  \n\n**Authors**:\n\nMaximilian Pichler: [\\@_Max_Pichler](https://twitter.com/_Max_Pichler)\n\nFlorian Hartig: [\\@florianhartig](https://twitter.com/florianhartig)\n\n\n**Contributors**:\n\nJohannes Oberpriller, Matthias Meier\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>\n```\n",
