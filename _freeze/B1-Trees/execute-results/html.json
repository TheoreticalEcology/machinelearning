In this lecture, we will explore regression and classification trees by the example of the airquality data set. There is one important hyperparameter for regression trees: \"minsplit\".\n\n-   It controls the depth of tree (see the help of rpart for a description).\n-   It controls the complexity of the tree and can thus also be seen as a regularization parameter.\n\nWe first prepare and visualize the data and afterwards fit a decision tree.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(rpart)\nlibrary(rpart.plot)\n\ndata = airquality[complete.cases(airquality),]\n```\n:::\n\n\nFit and visualize one(!) regression tree:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrt = rpart(Ozone~., data = data, control = rpart.control(minsplit = 10))\nrpart.plot(rt)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](B1-Trees_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nVisualize the predictions:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npred = predict(rt, data)\nplot(data$Temp, data$Ozone)\nlines(data$Temp[order(data$Temp)], pred[order(data$Temp)], col = \"red\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](B1-Trees_files/figure-html/chunk_chapter4_24-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe angular form of the prediction line is typical for regression trees and is a weakness of it.\n\n## Random Forest\n\nTo overcome this weakness, a random forest uses an ensemble of regression/classification trees. Thus, the random forest is in principle nothing else than a normal regression/classification tree, but it uses the idea of the *\"wisdom of the crowd\"* : By asking many people (regression/classification trees) one can make a more informed decision (prediction/classification). When you want to buy a new phone for example you also wouldn't go directly into the shop, but search in the internet and ask your friends and family.\n\nThere are two randomization steps with the random forest that are responsible for their success:\n\n-   Bootstrap samples for each tree (we will sample observations with replacement from the data set. For the phone this is like not everyone has experience about each phone).\n-   At each split, we will sample a subset of predictors that is then considered as potential splitting criterion (for the phone this is like that not everyone has the same decision criteria). Annotation: While building a decision tree (random forests consist of many decision trees), one splits the data at some point according to their features. For example if you have females and males, big and small people in a crowd, you con split this crowd by gender and then by size or by size and then by gender to build a decision tree.\n\nApplying the random forest follows the same principle as for the methods before: We visualize the data (we have already done this so often for the airquality data set, thus we skip it here), fit the algorithm and then plot the outcomes.\n\nFit a random forest and visualize the predictions:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(randomForest)\nset.seed(123)\n\ndata = airquality[complete.cases(airquality),]\n\nrf = randomForest(Ozone~., data = data)\npred = predict(rf, data)\nplot(Ozone~Temp, data = data)\nlines(data$Temp[order(data$Temp)], pred[order(data$Temp)], col = \"red\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](B1-Trees_files/figure-html/chunk_chapter4_25-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne advantage of random forests is that we will get an importance of variables. At each split in each tree, the improvement in the split-criterion is the importance measure attributed to the splitting variable, and is accumulated over all the trees in the forest separately for each variable. Thus the variable importance shows us how important a variable is averaged over all trees.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrf$importance\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n        IncNodePurity\nSolar.R      17969.59\nWind         31978.36\nTemp         34176.71\nMonth        10753.73\nDay          15436.47\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are several important hyperparameters in a random forest that we can tune to get better results:\n\n| Hyperparameter    | Explanation                                                                                                                              |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| mtry              | Subset of features randomly selected in each node (from which the algorithm can select the feature that will be used to split the data). |\n| minimum node size | Minimal number of observations allowed in a node (before the branching is canceled)                                                      |\n| max depth         | Maximum number of tree depth                                                                                                             |\n\n## Boosted Regression Trees\n\nRandom forests fit hundreds of trees independent of each other. Here, the idea of a boosted regression tree comes in. Maybe we could learn from the errors the previous weak learners made and thus enhance the performance of the algorithm.\n\nA boosted regression tree (BRT) starts with a simple regression tree (weak learner) and then sequentially fits additional trees to improve the results. There are two different strategies to do so:\n\n-   *AdaBoost*: Wrong classified observations (by the previous tree) will get a higher weight and therefore the next trees will focus on difficult/missclassified observations.\n-   *Gradient boosting* (state of the art): Each sequential model will be fit on the residual errors of the previous model (strongly simplified, the actual algorithm is very complex).\n\nWe can fit a boosted regression tree using xgboost, but before we have to transform the data into a xgb.Dmatrix (which is a xgboost specific data type, the package sadly doesn't support R matrices or data.frames).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(xgboost)\nset.seed(123)\n\ndata = airquality[complete.cases(airquality),]\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_xg = xgb.DMatrix(data = as.matrix(scale(data[,-1])), label = data$Ozone)\nbrt = xgboost(data_xg, nrounds = 16L)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]\ttrain-rmse:39.724624 \n[2]\ttrain-rmse:30.225761 \n[3]\ttrain-rmse:23.134840 \n[4]\ttrain-rmse:17.899179 \n[5]\ttrain-rmse:14.097785 \n[6]\ttrain-rmse:11.375457 \n[7]\ttrain-rmse:9.391276 \n[8]\ttrain-rmse:7.889690 \n[9]\ttrain-rmse:6.646586 \n[10]\ttrain-rmse:5.804859 \n[11]\ttrain-rmse:5.128437 \n[12]\ttrain-rmse:4.456416 \n[13]\ttrain-rmse:4.069464 \n[14]\ttrain-rmse:3.674615 \n[15]\ttrain-rmse:3.424578 \n[16]\ttrain-rmse:3.191301 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe parameter \"nrounds\" controls how many sequential trees we fit, in our example this was 16. When we predict on new data, we can limit the number of trees used to prevent overfitting (remember: each new tree tries to improve the predictions of the previous trees).\n\nLet us visualize the predictions for different numbers of trees:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noldpar = par(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nfor(i in 1:4){\n  pred = predict(brt, newdata = data_xg, ntreelimit = i)\n  plot(data$Temp, data$Ozone, main = i)\n  lines(data$Temp[order(data$Temp)], pred[order(data$Temp)], col = \"red\")\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[16:05:57] WARNING: src/c_api/c_api.cc:935: `ntree_limit` is deprecated, use `iteration_range` instead.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[16:05:57] WARNING: src/c_api/c_api.cc:935: `ntree_limit` is deprecated, use `iteration_range` instead.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[16:05:57] WARNING: src/c_api/c_api.cc:935: `ntree_limit` is deprecated, use `iteration_range` instead.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[16:05:57] WARNING: src/c_api/c_api.cc:935: `ntree_limit` is deprecated, use `iteration_range` instead.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](B1-Trees_files/figure-html/chunk_chapter4_29__BRT2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(oldpar)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are also other ways to control for complexity of the boosted regression tree algorithm:\n\n-   max_depth: Maximum depth of each tree.\n-   shrinkage (each tree will get a weight and the weight will decrease with the number of trees).\n\nWhen having specified the final model, we can obtain the importance of the variables like for random forests:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxgboost::xgb.importance(model = brt)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Feature        Gain     Cover  Frequency\n    <char>       <num>     <num>      <num>\n1:    Temp 0.570072012 0.2958229 0.24836601\n2:    Wind 0.348230653 0.3419576 0.24183007\n3: Solar.R 0.058795502 0.1571072 0.30718954\n4:     Day 0.019529985 0.1779925 0.16993464\n5:   Month 0.003371847 0.0271197 0.03267974\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsqrt(mean((data$Ozone - pred)^2)) # RMSE\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 17.89918\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_xg = xgb.DMatrix(data = as.matrix(scale(data[,-1])), label = data$Ozone)\n```\n:::\n\n\nOne important strength of xgboost is that we can directly do a cross-validation (which is independent of the boosted regression tree itself!) and specify its properties with the parameter \"n-fold\":\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(123)\n\nbrt = xgboost(data_xg, nrounds = 5L)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]\ttrain-rmse:39.724624 \n[2]\ttrain-rmse:30.225761 \n[3]\ttrain-rmse:23.134840 \n[4]\ttrain-rmse:17.899179 \n[5]\ttrain-rmse:14.097785 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbrt_cv = xgboost::xgb.cv(data = data_xg, nfold = 3L,\n                         nrounds = 3L, nthreads = 4L)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]\ttrain-rmse:39.895106+2.127355\ttest-rmse:40.685477+5.745327 \n[2]\ttrain-rmse:30.367660+1.728788\ttest-rmse:32.255812+5.572963 \n[3]\ttrain-rmse:23.446237+1.366757\ttest-rmse:27.282435+5.746244 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(brt_cv)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n##### xgb.cv 3-folds\n  iter train_rmse_mean train_rmse_std test_rmse_mean test_rmse_std\n <num>           <num>          <num>          <num>         <num>\n     1        39.89511       2.127355       40.68548      5.745327\n     2        30.36766       1.728788       32.25581      5.572963\n     3        23.44624       1.366757       27.28244      5.746244\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnnotation: The original data set is randomly partitioned into $n$ equal sized subsamples.
