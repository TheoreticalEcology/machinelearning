A typical example is to understand how important different variables are for predictions. The incentives for doing so range from a better technical understanding of the models over understanding which data is important for improving predictions to questions of fairness and discrimination (e.g. to understand if an algorithm uses skin color to make a decision).\n\n## A Practical Example\n\nIn this lecture we will work with another famous data set, the *Boston housing* data set:\n\nWe will fit a random forest and use the iml package for xAI, see <a href=\"https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/</a>.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(iml)\nlibrary(randomForest)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nrandomForest 4.7-1.1\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nType rfNews() to see new features/changes/bug fixes.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(123)\n\ndata(\"Boston\", package = \"MASS\")\nrf = randomForest(medv ~ ., data = Boston, ntree = 50)\n```\n:::\n\n\nxAI packages are written generic, i.e. they can handle almost all machine learning models. When we want to use them, we first have to create a predictor object, that holds the model and the data. The iml package uses R6 classes, that means new objects can be created by calling Predictor\\$new(). (Do not worry if you do not know what R6 classes are, just use the command.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nX = Boston[which(names(Boston) != \"medv\")]\npredictor = Predictor$new(rf, data = X, y = Boston$medv)\n# \"Predictor\" is an object generator.\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Feature Importance\n\nFeature importance should not be mistaken with the random forest variable importance though they are related. It tells us how important the individual variables are for predictions, can be calculated for all machine learning models and is based on a permutation approach (have a look at the book):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimp = FeatureImp$new(predictor, loss = \"mae\")\nplot(imp)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](D2-explainableAI_files/figure-html/chunk_chapter6_2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Partial Dependencies\n\nPartial dependencies are similar to allEffects plots for normal regressions. The idea is to visualize \"marginal effects\" of predictors (with the \"feature\" argument we specify the variable we want to visualize):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neff = FeatureEffect$new(predictor, feature = \"rm\", method = \"pdp\",\n                        grid.size = 30)\nplot(eff)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](D2-explainableAI_files/figure-html/chunk_chapter6_3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPartial dependencies can also be plotted for single observations:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neff = FeatureEffect$new(predictor, feature = \"rm\", method = \"pdp+ice\",\n                        grid.size = 30)\nplot(eff)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](D2-explainableAI_files/figure-html/chunk_chapter6_4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne disadvantage of partial dependencies is that they are sensitive to correlated predictors. Accumulated local effects can be used for accounting for correlation of predictors.\n\n## Accumulated Local Effects\n\nAccumulated local effects (ALE) are basically partial dependencies plots but try to correct for correlations between predictors.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nale = FeatureEffect$new(predictor, feature = \"rm\", method = \"ale\")\nale$plot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](D2-explainableAI_files/figure-html/chunk_chapter6_5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf there is no collinearity, you shouldn't see much difference between partial dependencies and ALE plots.\n\n## Friedman's H-statistic\n\nThe H-statistic can be used to find interactions between predictors. However, again, keep in mind that the H-statistic is sensible to correlation between predictors:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninteract = Interaction$new(predictor, \"lstat\")\nplot(interact)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](D2-explainableAI_files/figure-html/chunk_chapter6_6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Global Explainer - Simplifying the Machine Learning Model\n\nAnother idea is simplifying the machine learning model with another simpler model such as a decision tree. We create predictions with the machine learning model for a lot of different input values and then we fit a decision tree on these predictions. We can then interpret the easier model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(partykit)\n\ntree = TreeSurrogate$new(predictor, maxdepth = 2)\nplot(tree$tree)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](D2-explainableAI_files/figure-html/chunk_chapter6_7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Local Explainer - LIME Explaining Single Instances (observations)\n\nThe global approach is to simplify the entire machine learning-black-box model via a simpler model, which is then interpretable.\n\nHowever, sometimes we are only interested in understanding how single predictions are generated. The LIME (Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) approach explores the feature space around one observation and based on this locally fits a simpler model (e.g. a linear model):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlime.explain = LocalModel$new(predictor, x.interest = X[1,])\nlime.explain$results\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n              beta x.recoded    effect x.original feature feature.value\nrm       4.1893817     6.575 27.545185      6.575      rm      rm=6.575\nptratio -0.5307031    15.300 -8.119758       15.3 ptratio  ptratio=15.3\nlstat   -0.4398104     4.980 -2.190256       4.98   lstat    lstat=4.98\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(lime.explain)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](D2-explainableAI_files/figure-html/chunk_chapter6_8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Local Explainer - Shapley\n\nThe Shapley method computes the so called Shapley value, feature contributions for single predictions, and is based on an approach from cooperative game theory. The idea is that each feature value of the instance is a \"player\" in a game, where the prediction is the reward. The Shapley value tells us how to fairly distribute the reward among the features.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshapley = Shapley$new(predictor, x.interest = X[1,])\nshapley$plot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](D2-explainableAI_files/figure-html/chunk_chapter6_9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Exercises\n\n::: {.callout-caution icon=\"false\"}\n#### Question\n\nUse one of the non-image based data sets (preferably Wine, which is also described in the data sets section @sec-datasets but wasn't used yet, but you can also use Nasa or Titanic) and fit a random forest.

What about a boosted regression tree or an artificial neural network? Take the random forest example and add a boosted regression tree (easier, you can use e.g. <https://rdrr.io/cran/xgboost/man/xgb.importance.html>) or an artificial neural network and see if they are better than the random forest at identifying causal predictors.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Click here to see the solution</button>\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(xgboost)\nset.seed(1234)\n\ndata = as.data.frame(EcoData::wine)\nsubmission = data[which(is.na(data$quality)), -which(colnames(data) == \"quality\")]\ndata = data[complete.cases(data), ] # Removes sumbmission data as well.\n\ndata_xg = xgb.DMatrix(\n  data = as.matrix(data[,which(names(data) != \"quality\")]),\n  label = data$quality\n)\nbrt = xgboost(data_xg, nrounds = 24)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]\ttrain-rmse:3.656523 \n[2]\ttrain-rmse:2.609494 \n[3]\ttrain-rmse:1.884807 \n[4]\ttrain-rmse:1.384918 \n[5]\ttrain-rmse:1.037362 \n[6]\ttrain-rmse:0.800110 \n[7]\ttrain-rmse:0.629324 \n[8]\ttrain-rmse:0.508917 \n[9]\ttrain-rmse:0.426155 \n[10]\ttrain-rmse:0.369580 \n[11]\ttrain-rmse:0.313017 \n[12]\ttrain-rmse:0.274227 \n[13]\ttrain-rmse:0.236959 \n[14]\ttrain-rmse:0.207364 \n[15]\ttrain-rmse:0.195811 \n[16]\ttrain-rmse:0.182500 \n[17]\ttrain-rmse:0.173310 \n[18]\ttrain-rmse:0.154747 \n[19]\ttrain-rmse:0.144045 \n[20]\ttrain-rmse:0.139083 \n[21]\ttrain-rmse:0.129605 \n[22]\ttrain-rmse:0.118541 \n[23]\ttrain-rmse:0.110689 \n[24]\ttrain-rmse:0.097798 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npred = round(predict(brt, newdata = data_xg)) # Only integers are allowed.\ntable(pred, data$quality)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    \npred   3   4   5   6   7   8\n   3   2   0   0   0   0   0\n   4   0  10   0   0   0   0\n   5   0   0 136   0   0   0\n   6   0   0   0 113   1   0\n   7   0   0   0   0  34   0\n   8   0   0   0   0   0   3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(accuracy = mean(pred == data$quality)) # Fits very well (on the training data...)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.9966555\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# For submission:\n#write.csv(round(predict(rf, submission)), file = \"wine_RF.csv\")\n\n# Look at variable importance:\nxgboost::xgb.importance(model = brt)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                 Feature       Gain      Cover  Frequency\n 1:              alcohol 0.28363854 0.13667721 0.07073509\n 2:            sulphates 0.11331809 0.07015405 0.06657420\n 3:        fixed.acidity 0.09844424 0.11359510 0.19278779\n 4:     volatile.acidity 0.09582787 0.07098397 0.12760055\n 5: total.sulfur.dioxide 0.09207959 0.09147259 0.07212205\n 6:              density 0.07374571 0.14910006 0.08321775\n 7:            chlorides 0.06025507 0.07972405 0.08876560\n 8:       residual.sugar 0.05307941 0.07202137 0.08044383\n 9:  free.sulfur.dioxide 0.04602735 0.04743503 0.06518724\n10:                   pH 0.04477571 0.12562892 0.07489598\n11:          citric.acid 0.03880842 0.04320764 0.07766990\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEvery method yields slightly different results, but the main ingredient is alcohol (and sulphates).\n\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution icon=\"false\"}\n#### Bonus Task\n\nIf you're done with the previous tasks and have still time and appetite, improve the submissions for our competition, in particular for the Wine data set.
