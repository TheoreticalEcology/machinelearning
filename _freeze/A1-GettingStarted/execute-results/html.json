For this, the following should work for most people:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"keras3\", dependencies = TRUE)\nkeras3::install_keras(backend=\"tensorflow\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis should work on most computers, in particular if all software is recent. Sometimes, however, things don't work well, especially the python distribution often makes problems. If the installation does not work for you, we can look at it together. Also, we will provide some virtual machines in case your computers / laptops are too old or you don't manage to install TensorFlow.\n\n## Torch for R\n\nWe may also use Torch for R. This is an R frontend for the popular PyTorch framework. To install Torch, type in R:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"torch\")\nlibrary(torch)\ntorch::install_torch()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## EcoData\n\nWe use data sets from the EcoData package. To install the package, run:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndevtools::install_github(repo = \"TheoreticalEcology/EcoData\", \n                         dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe default installation will install a number of packages that are useful for statistics. Especially in Linux, this may take some time to install. If you are in a hurry and only want the data, you can also run\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndevtools::install_github(repo = \"TheoreticalEcology/EcoData\", \n                         dependencies = FALSE, build_vignettes = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Further Used Libraries\n\nWe will make huge use of different libraries. So take a coffee or two (that will take a while...) and install the following libraries. Please do this in the given order unless you know what you're doing, because there are some dependencies between the packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"abind\")\ninstall.packages(\"animation\")\ninstall.packages(\"ape\")\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\")\nBiocManager::install(c(\"Rgraphviz\", \"graph\", \"RBGL\"))\ninstall.packages(\"coro\")\ninstall.packages(\"cito\")\ninstall.packages(\"dbscan\")\ninstall.packages(\"dendextend\")\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\ninstall.packages(\"e1071\")\ninstall.packages(\"factoextra\")\ninstall.packages(\"fields\")\ninstall.packages(\"forcats\")\ninstall.packages(\"glmnet\")\ninstall.packages(\"glmnetUtils\")\ninstall.packages(\"gym\")\ninstall.packages(\"kknn\")\ninstall.packages(\"knitr\")\ninstall.packages(\"iml\")\ninstall.packages(\"lavaan\")\ninstall.packages(\"lmtest\")\ninstall.packages(\"magick\")\ninstall.packages(\"mclust\")\ninstall.packages(\"Metrics\")\ninstall.packages(\"microbenchmark\")\ninstall.packages(\"missRanger\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlbench\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3learners\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3measures\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3pipelines\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3tuning\")\ninstall.packages(\"paradox\")\ninstall.packages(\"partykit\")\ninstall.packages(\"pcalg\")\ninstall.packages(\"piecewiseSEM\")\ninstall.packages(\"purrr\")\ninstall.packages(\"randomForest\")\ninstall.packages(\"ranger\")\ninstall.packages(\"rpart\")\ninstall.packages(\"rpart.plot\")\ninstall.packages(\"scales\")\ninstall.packages(\"semPlot\")\ninstall.packages(\"stringr\")\ninstall.packages(\"tfprobability\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"torchvision\")\ninstall.packages(\"xgboost\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidymodels\")\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"andrie/deepviz\", dependencies = TRUE,\n                         upgrade = \"always\")\ndevtools::install_github('skinner927/reprtree')\ndevtools::install_version(\"lavaanPlot\", version = \"0.6.0\")\n\nreticulate::conda_install(\"r-keras\", packages = \"scipy\", pip = TRUE)\nreticulate::conda_install(\"r-keras\", packages = \"tensorflow_probability\", pip = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Linux/UNIX systems have sometimes to fulfill some further dependencies\n\n**Debian based systems**\n\nFor Debian based systems, we need:\n\n```         \nbuild-essential\ngfortran\nlibmagick++-dev\nr-base-dev\n```\n\nIf you are new to installing packages on Debian / Ubuntu, etc., type the following:\n\n```         \nsudo apt update && sudo apt install -y --install-recommends build-essential gfortran libmagick++-dev r-base-dev\n```\n\n## Reminders About Basic Operations in R\n\nBasic and advanced knowledge of R is required to successfully participate in this course. If you would like to refresh your knowledge of R, you can review the chapter ['Reminder: R Basics'](https://theoreticalecology.github.io/AdvancedRegressionModels/1A-GettingStarted.html#assumed-r-knowledge) from the advanced statistic course.\n",
