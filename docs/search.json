    "text": "Preface\nMachine learning (ML) is the process of building a predictive model that makes predictions about new data based on observations (training data). The goal of this course is to enable you to build a robust ML model, one that generalizes well to new observations and does not “overfit” your training data. To do this, you will need to master a number of skills, in particular\nIn recent years, a new field within ML called Deep Learning (DL) has emerged and attracted a lot of attention. The reason for this is that DL incorporates many different but very flexible architectures that allow to natively model different types of data, e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks for images or Recurrent Neural Networks for time series. However, exploiting the flexibility of DL requires a deeper, more fundamental understanding of the frameworks in which they are implemented. To this end, the course will also cover common DL frameworks such as torch (and TensorFlow) and:",

For Mac users, if you have already a M1-M3 Mac, please install the R-ARM version (see here (not the x86_64 version))\n\n\n1.2.2 TensorFlow and Keras\nIf you want to run the code on your own computers, you need to install TensorFlow / Keras for R. For this, the following should work for most people:\n\ninstall.packages(\"keras3\", dependencies = TRUE)\nkeras3::install_keras(backend=\"tensorflow\")\n\nThis should work on most computers, in particular if all software is recent. Sometimes, however, things don’t work well, especially the python distribution often makes problems. If the installation does not work for you, we can look at it together. Also, we will provide some virtual machines in case your computers / laptops are too old or you don’t manage to install TensorFlow.\n\n\n1.2.3 Torch for R\nWe may also use Torch for R. This is an R frontend for the popular PyTorch framework. To install Torch, type in R:\n\ninstall.packages(\"torch\")\nlibrary(torch)\ntorch::install_torch()\n\n\n\n1.2.4 EcoData\nWe use data sets from the EcoData package. To install the package, run:\n\ndevtools::install_github(repo = \"TheoreticalEcology/EcoData\", \n                         dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)\n\nThe default installation will install a number of packages that are useful for statistics. Especially in Linux, this may take some time to install. If you are in a hurry and only want the data, you can also run\n\ndevtools::install_github(repo = \"TheoreticalEcology/EcoData\", \n                         dependencies = FALSE, build_vignettes = FALSE)\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Additional Libraries\nThere are a number of additional libraries that we may use during the course. So take a coffee or two (that will take a while…) and install the following libraries. Please do this in the given order unless you know what you’re doing, because there are some dependencies between the packages.\n\ninstall.packages(\"abind\")\ninstall.packages(\"animation\")\ninstall.packages(\"ape\")\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\")\nBiocManager::install(c(\"Rgraphviz\", \"graph\", \"RBGL\"))\ninstall.packages(\"coro\")\ninstall.packages(\"cito\")\ninstall.packages(\"dbscan\")\ninstall.packages(\"dendextend\")\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\ninstall.packages(\"e1071\")\ninstall.packages(\"factoextra\")\ninstall.packages(\"fields\")\ninstall.packages(\"forcats\")\ninstall.packages(\"glmnet\")\ninstall.packages(\"glmnetUtils\")\ninstall.packages(\"gym\")\ninstall.packages(\"kknn\")\ninstall.packages(\"knitr\")\ninstall.packages(\"iml\")\ninstall.packages(\"lavaan\")\ninstall.packages(\"lmtest\")\ninstall.packages(\"magick\")\ninstall.packages(\"mclust\")\ninstall.packages(\"Metrics\")\ninstall.packages(\"microbenchmark\")\ninstall.packages(\"missRanger\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlbench\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3learners\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3measures\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3pipelines\")\ninstall.packages(\"mlr3tuning\")\ninstall.packages(\"paradox\")\ninstall.packages(\"partykit\")\ninstall.packages(\"pcalg\")\ninstall.packages(\"piecewiseSEM\")\ninstall.packages(\"purrr\")\ninstall.packages(\"randomForest\")\ninstall.packages(\"ranger\")\ninstall.packages(\"rpart\")\ninstall.packages(\"rpart.plot\")\ninstall.packages(\"scales\")\ninstall.packages(\"semPlot\")\ninstall.packages(\"stringr\")\ninstall.packages(\"tfprobability\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"torchvision\")\ninstall.packages(\"xgboost\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidymodels\")\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"andrie/deepviz\", dependencies = TRUE,\n                         upgrade = \"always\")\ndevtools::install_github('skinner927/reprtree')\ndevtools::install_version(\"lavaanPlot\", version = \"0.6.0\")\n\nreticulate::virtualenv_install(\"r-keras\", packages = \"scipy\")\nreticulate::virtualenv_install(\"r-keras\", packages = \"tensorflow_probability\")",

The general steps to get the trained model include:\nThe goal of this course is that you can answer the following questions:\nTypically we can define roughly three types of ML tasks:\nSupervised learning, you train algorithms to predict something (classes = classification or values = regression) from some other data (= features), and you provide it with correct examples of the execution of the task (called training data). A linear regression is an example of supervised learning. Given \\(y = f(x)\\) with \\(x\\) our input feature (e.g. precipitation), \\(y\\) our response (growth), and \\(f\\) an unknown function that maps \\(x \\rightarrow y\\) . The goal of supervised learning is to train a ML algorithm to approximate \\(f\\) given observed \\((x_i, y_i)\\) pairs.\nUnsupervised learning, on the other hand, is when you provide the features, but no examples of the correct execution of the task. Clustering techniques are examples of unsupervised learning. (In the example above, \\(y\\) would be unknown).\nReinforcement learning is a technique that mimics a game-like situation. The algorithm finds a solution through trial and error, receiving either rewards or penalties for each action. As in games, the goal is to maximize the rewards. We will talk more about this technique on the last day of the course.\nFor now, we will focus on the first two tasks, supervised and unsupervised learning (here a YouTube video explaining again the difference).",

    "section": "2.2 Unsupervised Learning",
    "text": "2.2 Unsupervised Learning\nIn unsupervised learning, we want to identify patterns in data without having any examples (supervision) about what the correct patterns / classes are. As an example, consider the iris data set. Here, we have 150 observations of 4 floral traits:\n\niris = datasets::iris\ncolors = hcl.colors(3)\ntraits = as.matrix(iris[,1:4])\nspecies = iris$Species\nimage(y = 1:4, x = 1:length(species) , z = traits,\n      ylab = \"Floral trait\", xlab = \"Individual\")\nsegments(50.5, 0, 50.5, 5, col = \"black\", lwd = 2)\nsegments(100.5, 0, 100.5, 5, col = \"black\", lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\nTrait distributions of iris dataset\n\n\n\n\nThe observations are from 3 species and indeed those species tend to have different traits, meaning that the observations form 3 clusters.\n\npairs(traits, pch = as.integer(species), col = colors[as.integer(species)])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, imagine we don’t know what species are, what is basically the situation in which people in the antique have been. The people just noted that some plants have different flowers than others, and decided to give them different names. This kind of process is what unsupervised learning does.\n\n2.2.1 K-means Clustering\nAn example for an unsupervised learning algorithm is k-means clustering, one of the simplest and most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms (see more on this in section “distance based algorithms”).\nTo start with the algorithm, you first have to specify the number of clusters (for our example the number of species). Each cluster has a centroid, which is the assumed or real location representing the center of the cluster (for our example this would be how an average plant of a specific species would look like). The algorithm starts by randomly putting centroids somewhere. Afterwards each data point is assigned to the respective cluster that raises the overall in-cluster sum of squares (variance) related to the distance to the centroid least of all. After the algorithm has placed all data points into a cluster the centroids get updated. By iterating this procedure until the assignment doesn’t change any longer, the algorithm can find the (locally) optimal centroids and the data points belonging to this cluster. Note that results might differ according to the initial positions of the centroids. Thus several (locally) optimal solutions might be found.\nThe “k” in K-means refers to the number of clusters and the ‘means’ refers to averaging the data-points to find the centroids.\nA typical pipeline for using k-means clustering looks the same as for other algorithms. After having visualized the data, we fit a model, visualize the results and have a look at the performance by use of the confusion matrix. By setting a fixed seed, we can ensure that results are reproducible.\n\nset.seed(123)\n\n#Reminder: traits = as.matrix(iris[,1:4]).\n\nkc = kmeans(traits, 3)\nprint(kc)\n\nK-means clustering with 3 clusters of sizes 50, 62, 38\n\nCluster means:\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\n1     5.006000    3.428000     1.462000    0.246000\n2     5.901613    2.748387     4.393548    1.433871\n3     6.850000    3.073684     5.742105    2.071053\n\nClustering vector:\n  [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [38] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n [75] 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3\n[112] 3 3 2 2 3 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 3 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 2 3\n[149] 3 2\n\nWithin cluster sum of squares by cluster:\n[1] 15.15100 39.82097 23.87947\n (between_SS / total_SS =  88.4 %)\n\nAvailable components:\n\n[1] \"cluster\"      \"centers\"      \"totss\"        \"withinss\"     \"tot.withinss\"\n[6] \"betweenss\"    \"size\"         \"iter\"         \"ifault\"      \n\n\nVisualizing the results.

Furthermore, higher k than necessary tends to overfitting. At the kink in the picture, the sum of squares dropped enough and k is still low enough. But keep in mind, this is only a rule of thumb and might be wrong in some special cases.\n\n\nInformation criteria such as AIC or BIC can be also used to select the number of clusters and control complexity.",

    "text": "2.3 Supervised Learning\nThe two most prominent branches of supervised learning are regression and classification. The basic distinction between the two is that classification is about predicting a categorical variable, and regression is about predicting a continuous variable.\n\n2.3.1 Regression\nThe random forest (RF) algorithm is possibly the most widely used machine learning algorithm and can be used for regression and classification. We will talk more about the algorithm later.\nFor the moment, we want to go through a typical workflow for a supervised regression: First, we visualize the data. Next, we fit the model and lastly we visualize the results. We will again use the iris data set that we used before. The goal is now to predict Sepal.Length based on the information about the other variables (including species).\nFitting the model:\n\nlibrary(randomForest)\nset.seed(123)\n\nSepal.Length is a numerical variable:\n\nstr(iris)\n\n'data.frame':   150 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...\n $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...\n $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...\n $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...\n $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"setosa\",\"versicolor\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\nhist(iris$Sepal.Length)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe randomForest can be used similar to a linear regression model, we can specify the features using the formula syntax (~. means that all other variables should be used as features):\n\nm1 = randomForest(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = iris)   # ~.: Against all others.\nprint(m1)\n\n\nCall:\n randomForest(formula = Sepal.Length ~ ., data = iris) \n               Type of random forest: regression\n                     Number of trees: 500\nNo. of variables tried at each split: 1\n\n          Mean of squared residuals: 0.1364625\n                    % Var explained: 79.97\n\n\n\n\nIn statistics we would use a linear regression model:\n\nmLM = lm(Sepal.Length~., data = iris)\n\nAs many other ML algorithms, the RF is not interpretable, so we don’t get coefficients that connect the variables to the response. But, at least we get the variable importance which is similar to an anova, telling us which variables were the most important ones:\n\nvarImpPlot(m1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur liner model would report linear effects, however, the lm cannot keep up with the flexibility of a random forest!\n\ncoef(mLM)\n\n      (Intercept)       Sepal.Width      Petal.Length       Petal.Width \n        2.1712663         0.4958889         0.8292439        -0.3151552 \nSpeciesversicolor  Speciesvirginica \n       -0.7235620        -1.0234978 \n\n\nAnd the finally, we can use the model to make predictions using the predict method:\n\nplot(predict(m1), iris$Sepal.Length, xlab = \"Predicted\", ylab = \"Observed\")\nabline(0, 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand the structure of a random forest in more detail, we can use a package from GitHub.\n\nreprtree:::plot.getTree(m1, iris)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, one of the regression trees is shown.\n\n\n2.3.2 Classification\nWith the random forest, we can also do classification. The steps are the same as for regression tasks, but we can additionally see how well it performed by looking at the confusion matrix. Each row of this matrix contains the instances in a predicted class and each column represents the instances in the actual class.

Their ability to model different types of data (e.g. graphs, images) is one of the reasons for their rise in recent years. However, their use beyond tabular data (tabular data == features have specific meanings) requires extensive (programming) knowledge of the underlying deep learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow or PyTorch), which we will teach you in two days.

Each tree in the random forest is trained on a bootstrap of the data (bootstrap = sample with replacement from the original data, on average, each bootstrap will have 66% of the original data). Observations not used in a specific bootstrap are then used to validate the specific tree, bootstrap errors are at the end averaged for the n trees in the random forest.\nWhile we don’t get effect estimates as in a lm, we get the variable importance which reports how important the specific predictors are:\n\nvarImpPlot(model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictions\n\nhead(predict(model))\n\n     1      2      3      4      5      6 \nsetosa setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa \nLevels: setosa versicolor virginica\n\n\nThe model predicts the species class for each observation\nPerformance:\n\ntable(predict(model), as.integer(iris$Species))\n\n            \n              1  2  3\n  setosa     50  0  0\n  versicolor  0 47  3\n  virginica   0  3 47\n\n\nTask:\n\npredict Sepal.Length instead of Species (classification -&gt; regression)\nPlot predicted vs observed (usually used to asses the goodness of the predictions, if the model is good, predicted and observed values should be on one diagonal line)\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see the solution\n\nRegression:\nRandom Forest automatically infers the type of the task, so we don’t have to change much:\n\nmodel = randomForest(Sepal.Length~., data = iris_scaled)\n\nThe OOB error is now “% Var explained” which is very similar to a \\(R^2\\):\n\nprint(model)\n\n\nCall:\n randomForest(formula = Sepal.Length ~ ., data = iris_scaled) \n               Type of random forest: regression\n                     Number of trees: 500\nNo. of variables tried at each split: 1\n\n          Mean of squared residuals: 0.2031826\n                    % Var explained: 79.55\n\n\nPlot observed vs predicted:\n\nplot(iris_scaled$Sepal.Length, predict(model), xlim = c(-3, 3), ylim = c(-3, 3))\nabline(a = c(0, 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate \\(R^2\\):\n\ncor(iris_scaled$Sepal.Length, predict(model))**2\n\n[1] 0.7987894",

    "text": "3.1 Estimating error on the validation data\nYou probably remember from statistics that a more complex model always fits the training data better. The decisive question, however, is if it also works better on new (independent) data. Technically, we call this the out-of-sample error, as opposed to the in-sample error, which is the error on the training data.\nError can be measured in different ways, but usually we calculate some kind of accuracy (especially for classification tasks) or how much variance is explained by our model (regression tasks). We also distinguish between the error used to train the model and the error used to validate the model. The error used internally by the ML algorithms to train the model is what we usually call the loss. The smaller the loss, the smaller the error of the model, and vice versa for larger losses. We can also use losses to validate the models, but losses are often uninterpretable as they are often in the range [0, Inf[ and they cannot be generalized to other datasets because they are often data specific. Therefore, in practice, we usually use interpretable losses during validation that can be also used to compare the models over different datasets (Model A achieves 80% accuarcy on dataset A and 70% accuracy on dataset B), also called validation metrics, here is an overview of some common validation metrics and their interpretation:\nValidation metrics for classification tasks:\nValidation metrics for regression tasks:",

Let’s try a random forest\n\nlibrary(randomForest)\nm3 = randomForest(medv~., data = data[train,])\ncor(predict(m3), data[train,]$medv)\n\n[1] 0.9345165\n\ncor(predict(m3, newdata = data[-train,] ), \n    data[-train,]$medv)\n\n[1] 0.9380828\n\n\nNo drop on validation data (i.e. no overfitting), but error on training and validation is much better than for m1 - so this seems to be a better model, and m1 was probably underfitting, i.e. it was not complex enough to get good performance!\n\n\n3.1.3 Validation vs. cross-validation\nA problem with the validation split is that we test only on a certain fraction of the data (say: 20% in a 80/20 split).\nIf computationally possible, a better method to estimate error is cross-validation. The idea of cross-validation is to perform the train/validation split again and again until all data was used for the validation, and then average the validation error over this data.\nHere an example of a k-fold cross-validation, which is akin to 5x an 80/20 split.\n\nk = 5 # folds\nsplit = sample.int(k, n, replace = T)\npred = rep(NA, n)\n\nfor(i in 1:k){\n  m1 = randomForest(medv~., data = data[split != i,])\n  pred[split == i] = predict(m1, newdata = data[split == i,])\n}\n\ncor(pred, data$medv)\n\n[1] 0.9368875",

    "text": "3.2 Optimizing the bias-variance trade-off\n\n3.2.1 The bias-variance trade-off\nWhat we have just seen in the previous chapter is an example of the bias-variance trade-off. The idea is that we look at the error of the model on new test data. The total error comes from 2 contributions:\n\nBias = systematic error that comes from the fact that the model is not flexible enough, related to underfitting\nVariance = stochastic error that comes from that fact that estimates of the model parameters get more uncertain when we add complexity\n\nOptimizing the bias-variance trade-off means adjusting the complexity of the model which can be achieved by:\n\nFeature selection (more features increases the flexibility of the model)\nRegularization\n\n\n\nWhich of the following statements about the bias-variance trade-off is correct? (see figure above)\n\n The goal of considering the bias-variance trade-off is to realize that increasing complexity typically leads to more flexibility (allowing you to reduce bias) but at the cost of uncertainty (variance) in the estimated parameters. The goal of considering the bias-variance trade-off is to get the bias of the model as small as possible.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Feature selection\nAdding features increases the flexibility of the model and the goodness of fit:\n\nlibrary(mlbench)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:randomForest':\n\n    combine\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\ndata(BostonHousing)\ndata = BostonHousing\n\nsummary(lm(medv~rm, data = data))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = medv ~ rm, data = data)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-23.346  -2.547   0.090   2.986  39.433 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

So how do we decide which level of complexity is appropriate for our task? For the data we use to train the model, \\(R^2\\) will always get better with higher model complexity, so it is a poor decision criterion. We will show this in the Section 3.1.3 section. In short, the idea is that we need to split the data so that we have an evaluation (test) dataset that wasn’t used to train the model, which we can then use in turn to see if our model generalizes well to new data.\n\n\n3.2.3 Regularization\nRegularization means adding information or structure to a system in order to solve an ill-posed optimization problem or to prevent overfitting. There are many ways of regularizing a machine learning model. The most important distinction is between shrinkage estimators and estimators based on model averaging.\nShrinkage estimators are based on the idea of adding a penalty to the loss function that penalizes deviations of the model parameters from a particular value (typically 0). In this way, estimates are “shrunk” to the specified default value. In practice, the most important penalties are the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; also Lasso or LASSO, where the penalty is proportional to the sum of absolute deviations (\\(L1\\) penalty), and the Tikhonov regularization aka Ridge regression, where the penalty is proportional to the sum of squared distances from the reference (\\(L2\\) penalty). Thus, the loss function that we optimize is given by\n\\[\nloss = fit - \\lambda \\cdot d\n\\]\nwhere fit refers to the standard loss function, \\(\\lambda\\) is the strength of the regularization, and \\(d\\) is the chosen metric, e.g. \\(L1\\) or\\(L2\\):\n\\[\nloss_{L1} = fit - \\lambda \\cdot \\Vert weights \\Vert_1\n\\]\n\\[\nloss_{L2} = fit - \\lambda \\cdot \\Vert weights \\Vert_2\n\\]\n\\(\\lambda\\) and possibly d are typically optimized under cross-validation. \\(L1\\) and \\(L2\\) can be also combined what is then called elastic net (see Zou and Hastie (2005)).\nModel averaging refers to an entire set of techniques, including boosting, bagging and other averaging techniques. The general principle is that predictions are made by combining (= averaging) several models. This is based on on the insight that it is often more efficient having many simpler models and average them, than one “super model”. The reasons are complicated, and explained in more detail in Dormann et al. (2018).\nA particular important application of averaging is boosting, where the idea is that many weak learners are combined to a model average, resulting in a strong learner. Another related method is bootstrap aggregating, also called bagging. Idea here is to boostrap (use random sampling with replacement ) the data, and average the bootstrapped predictions.\nTo see how these techniques work in practice, let’s first focus on LASSO and Ridge regularization for weights in neural networks. We can imagine that the LASSO and Ridge act similar to a rubber band on the weights that pulls them to zero if the data does not strongly push them away from zero. This leads to important weights, which are supported by the data, being estimated as different from zero, whereas unimportant model structures are reduced (shrunken) to zero.\nLASSO \\(\\left(penalty \\propto \\sum_{}^{} \\mathrm{abs}(weights) \\right)\\) and Ridge \\(\\left(penalty \\propto \\sum_{}^{} weights^{2} \\right)\\) have slightly different properties. They are best understood if we express those as the effective prior preference they create on the parameters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the LASSO creates a very strong preference towards exactly zero, but falls off less strongly towards the tails. This means that parameters tend to be estimated either to exactly zero, or, if not, they are more free than the Ridge. For this reason, LASSO is often more interpreted as a model selection method.\nThe Ridge, on the other hand, has a certain area around zero where it is relatively indifferent about deviations from zero, thus rarely leading to exactly zero values. However, it will create a stronger shrinkage for values that deviate significantly from zero.\n\n3.2.3.1 Ridge - Example\nWe can use the glmnet package for Ridge, LASSO, and elastic-net regressions.\nWe want to predict the house prices of Boston (see help of the dataset):\n\nlibrary(mlbench)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(glmnet)\n\nLoading required package: Matrix\n\n\nLoaded glmnet 4.1-8\n\ndata(BostonHousing)\ndata = BostonHousing\nY = data$medv\nX = data %&gt;% select(-medv, -chas) %&gt;% scale()\n\nhist(cor(X))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nm1 = glmnet(y = Y, x = X, alpha = 0)\n\nThe glmnet function automatically tests different values for lambda:\n\ncbind(coef(m1, s = 0.001), coef(m1, s = 100.5))\n\n13 x 2 sparse Matrix of class \"dgCMatrix\"\n                     s1          s1\n(Intercept) 22.53280632 22.53280632\ncrim        -0.79174957 -0.21113427\nzn           0.76313031  0.18846808\nindus       -0.17037817 -0.25120998\nnox         -1.32794787 -0.21314250\nrm           2.85780876  0.46463202\nage         -0.05389395 -0.18279762\ndis         -2.38716188  0.07906631\nrad          1.42772476 -0.17967948\ntax         -1.09026758 -0.24233282\nptratio     -1.93105019 -0.31587466\nb            0.86718037  0.18764060\nlstat       -3.43236617 -0.46055837\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3.2 LASSO - Example\nBy changing \\(alpha\\) to 1.0 we use a LASSO instead of a Ridge regression:\n\nm2 = glmnet(y = Y, x = X, alpha = 1.0)\ncbind(coef(m2, s = 0.001), coef(m2, s = 0.5))\n\n13 x 2 sparse Matrix of class \"dgCMatrix\"\n                     s1           s1\n(Intercept) 22.53280632 22.532806324\ncrim        -0.95543108 -0.135047323\nzn           1.06718108  .          \nindus        0.21519500  .          \nnox         -1.95945910 -0.000537715\nrm           2.71666891  2.998520195\nage          0.05184895  .          \ndis         -3.10566908 -0.244045205\nrad          2.73963771  .          \ntax         -2.20279273  .          \nptratio     -2.13052857 -1.644234575\nb            0.88420283  0.561686909\nlstat       -3.80177809 -3.682148016\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3.3 Elastic-net - Example\nBy setting \\(alpha\\) to a value between 0 and 1.0, we use a combination of LASSO and Rdige:\n\nm3 = glmnet(y = Y, x = X, alpha = 0.5)\ncbind(coef(m3, s = 0.001), coef(m3, s = 0.5))\n\n13 x 2 sparse Matrix of class \"dgCMatrix\"\n                     s1         s1\n(Intercept) 22.53280632 22.5328063\ncrim        -0.95716118 -0.3488473\nzn           1.06836343  0.1995842\nindus        0.21825187  .        \nnox         -1.96211736 -0.7613698\nrm           2.71859592  3.0137090\nage          0.05299551  .        \ndis         -3.10330132 -1.3011740\nrad          2.73321635  .        \ntax         -2.19638611  .        \nptratio     -2.13041090 -1.8051547\nb            0.88458269  0.6897165\nlstat       -3.79836182 -3.6136853",

    "text": "3.3 Hyperparameter tuning\n\n3.3.1 What is a hyperparameter?\nGenerally, parameters such as \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) that, for example, control the complexity of the model or other model features such as learning or the optimization are called hyperparameters.\nHyperparameter tuning describes the process of finding the optimal set of hyperparameters for a certain task. They are usually data specific, so they have to tuned for each dataset.\nLet’s have a look at this using our glmnet example - we can plot the effect of \\(\\lambda\\) on the effect estimates:\n\nplot(m1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo which lambda should we choose now? If we calculate the model fit for different lambdas (e.g. using the RMSE):\n\nlambdas = seq(0.001, 1.5, length.out = 100)\nRMSEs = \n  sapply(lambdas, function(l) {\n    prediction = predict(m1, newx = X, s = l)\n    RMSE = Metrics::rmse(Y, prediction)\n    return(RMSE)\n    })\nplot(lambdas, RMSEs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the lowest lambda achieved the highest RMSE - which is not surprising because the unconstrained model, the most complex model, has the highest fit, so no bias but probably high variance (with respect to the bias-variance tradeoff).\n\n\n3.3.2 Tuning with a train / test split\nWe want a model that generalizes well to new data, which we need to “simulate” here by splitting of a holdout before the training and using the holdout then for testing our model. This split is often called the train / test split.\n\nset.seed(1)\nlibrary(mlbench)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(glmnet)\ndata(BostonHousing)\ndata = BostonHousing\nY = data$medv\nX = data %&gt;% select(-medv, -chas) %&gt;% scale()\n\n# Split data\nindices = sample.int(nrow(X), 0.2*nrow(X))\ntrain_X = X[indices,]\ntest_X = X[-indices,]\ntrain_Y = Y[indices]\ntest_Y = Y[-indices]\n\n# Train model on train data\nm1 = glmnet(y = train_Y, x = train_X, alpha = 0.5)\n\n# Test model on test data\npred = predict(m1, newx = test_X, s = 0.01)\n\n# Calculate performance on test data\nMetrics::rmse(test_Y, pred)\n\n[1] 5.063774\n\n\nLet’s do it again for different values of lambdas:\n\nlambdas = seq(0.0000001, 0.5, length.out = 100)\nRMSEs = \n  sapply(lambdas, function(l) {\n    prediction = predict(m1, newx = test_X, s = l)\n    return(Metrics::rmse(test_Y, prediction))\n    })\nplot(lambdas, RMSEs, xlab = \"Lambda\", ylab = \"RMSE\", type = \"l\", las = 2)\nabline(v = lambdas[which.min(RMSEs)], col = \"red\", lwd = 1.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you automatically run a CV to determine the hyperparameters for glmnet, using the cv.glmnet function which does per default a 5xCV (so 5 splits) and in each split different values for \\(\\lambda\\) are tested\n\nm1 = glmnet::cv.glmnet(x = X, y = Y, alpha = 0.5, nfolds = 5)\nm1\n\n\nCall:  glmnet::cv.glmnet(x = X, y = Y, nfolds = 5, alpha = 0.5) \n\nMeasure: Mean-Squared Error \n\n    Lambda Index Measure    SE Nonzero\nmin 0.0105    78   23.80 3.247      12\n1se 0.6905    33   26.88 4.014       8\n\nplot(m1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nm1$lambda.min\n\n[1] 0.01049538\n\n\nSo low values of \\(\\lambda\\) seem to achieve the lowest error, thus the highest predictive performance.\n\n\n3.3.3 Nested (cross)-validation\nIn the previous example, we have used the train/test split to find the best model. However, we have not done a validation split yet to see how the finally selected model would do on new data. This is absolutely necessary, because else you will overfit with your model selection to the test data.\nIf we have several nested splits, we talk about a nested validation / cross-validation. For each level, you can in principle switch between validation and cross-validation. Here, and example of tuning with a inner cross-validation and an outer validation.\n\n# outer split\nvalidation = sample.int(n, round(0.2*n))\ndat = data[-validation,]\n\n# inner split\nnI = nrow(dat)\nhyperparameter = data.frame(mtry = c(3,5))\nm = nrow(hyperparameter)\nk = 5 # folds\nsplit = sample.int(k, nI, replace = T)\n\n\n# making predictions for all hyperparameters / splits\npred = matrix(NA, nI, m)\nfor(l in 1:m){\n  for(i in 1:k){\n    m1 = randomForest(medv~., data = dat[split != i,], mtry = hyperparameter$mtry[l])\n    pred[split == i,l] = predict(m1, newdata = dat[split == i,])\n  }\n}\n\n# getting best hyperparameter option on test\ninnerLoss = function(x) cor(x, dat$medv)\nres = apply(pred, 2, innerLoss)\nchoice = which.max(res) \n\n# fitting model again with best hyperparameters \n# and all test / validation data \nmFinal = randomForest(medv~., data = dat, mtry = hyperparameter$mtry[choice])\n\n# testing final prediction on validation data \nfinalPred = predict(mFinal, newdata = data[validation,])\n\ncor(finalPred, \n    data[validation,]$medv)\n\n[1] 0.93926",

    "text": "3.4 Exercise - Predicting species interactions\nThe plant-pollinator database is a collection of plant-pollinator interactions with traits for plants and pollinators. The idea is pollinators interact with plants when their traits fit (e.g. the tongue of a bee needs to match the shape of a flower). We explored the advantage of machine learning algorithms over traditional statistical models in predicting species interactions in our paper. If you are interested you can have a look here.\nYou can also find a small explanation of he dataset in the Appendix of the book Section A.3 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask: Tune random orest model for the Plant-Pollinator dataset\n\n\n\nTune the min.node.size hyperparameter, from the randomForest help:\nmin.node.size = Minimum size of terminal nodes. Setting this number larger causes smaller trees to be grown (and thus take less time). Note that the default values are different for classification (1) and regression (5).\nNodesize determines the complexity of the individual trees (we will talk about the exact working tomorrow)\n1.

For example, the age variable has 20% NAs:\n\nsummary(data$age)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.1667 21.0000 28.0000 29.8811 39.0000 80.0000     263 \n\nsum(is.na(data$age)) / nrow(data)\n\n[1] 0.2009167\n\n\nThere are few options how to handle NAs:\n\nDrop observations with NAs, however, we may lose many observations (not what we want!)\nImputation, fill the missing values\n\nWe impute (fill) the missing values, for example with the median age. However, age itself might depend on other variables such as sex, class and title. Thus, instead of filling the NAs with the overall median of the passengers, we want to fill the NAs with the median age of these groups so that the associations with the other groups are preserved (or in other words, that the new values are hopefully closer to the unknown true values).\nIn tidyverse we can “group” the data, i.e. we will nest the observations within categorical variables for which we assume that there may be an association with age (here: group_by after sex, pclass and title). After grouping, all operations (such as our median(age....)) will be done within the specified groups (to get better estimates of these missing NAs).\n\ndata =\n  data %&gt;%\n    select(survived, sex, age, fare, pclass) %&gt;% \n    group_by(sex, pclass) %&gt;%\n    mutate(age2 = ifelse(is.na(age), median(age, na.rm = TRUE), age)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(fare2 = ifelse(is.na(fare), median(fare, na.rm = TRUE), fare)) %&gt;%\n    ungroup()\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Preprocessing and Feature Selection\nLater (tomorrow), we want to use Keras in our example, but it cannot handle factors and requires the data to be scaled.\nNormally, one would do this for all predictors, but as we only show the pipeline here, we have sub-selected a bunch of predictors and do this only for them. We first scale the numeric predictors and change the factors with only two groups/levels into integers (this can be handled by Keras).\n\ndata_sub =\n  data %&gt;%\n    select(survived, sex, age2, fare2, pclass) %&gt;%\n    mutate(age2 = scales::rescale(age2, c(0, 1)),\n           fare2 = scales::rescale(fare2, c(0, 1))) %&gt;%\n    mutate(sex = as.integer(sex) - 1L,\n           pclass = as.integer(pclass - 1L))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransforming factors with more than two levels\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors with more than two levels should be one hot encoded (Make columns for every different factor level and write 1 in the respective column for every taken feature value and 0 else. For example: \\(\\{red, green, green, blue, red\\} \\rightarrow \\{(0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,0), (1,0,0), (0,0,1)\\}\\)):\n\none_title = model.matrix(~0+as.factor(title), data = data)\ncolnames(one_title) = levels(data$title)\n\none_sex = model.matrix(~0+as.factor(sex), data = data)\ncolnames(one_sex) = levels(data$sex)\n\none_pclass = model.matrix(~0+as.factor(pclass), data = data)\ncolnames(one_pclass) = paste0(\"pclass\", 1:length(unique(data$pclass)))\n\nAnd we have to add the dummy encoded variables to the data set:\n\ndata = cbind(data.frame(survived= data$survived),\n                 one_title, one_sex, age = data$age2,\n                 fare = data$fare2, one_pclass)\nhead(data)",

Normally, we should do a nested CV on our training data (data_obs), however, we assume that the test data on the submission server is our outer split, so we can tune our hyperparameters using a n-fold Cross-Validation which serves as our inner CV.\n\n\nAgain, why is it important to tune hyperparameters? Hyperparameters (configuration parameters of our ML algorithms that (mostly) control their complexity) are usually tuned (optimized) in an automatic / systematic way. A common procedure, called random search, is to sample random configuration combinations from the set of hyperparameters and test for each combination the prediction error.\nWe implement manually a CV to tune the learning rate.

    "text": "5.2 Random Forest\nTo overcome this weakness, a random forest uses an ensemble of regression/classification trees. Thus, the random forest is in principle nothing else than a normal regression/classification tree, but it uses the idea of the “wisdom of the crowd” : By asking many people (regression/classification trees) one can make a more informed decision (prediction/classification). When you want to buy a new phone for example you also wouldn’t go directly into the shop, but search in the internet and ask your friends and family.\nThere are two randomization steps with the random forest that are responsible for their success:\n\nBootstrap samples for each tree (we will sample observations with replacement from the data set. For the phone this is like not everyone has experience about each phone).\nAt each split, we will sample a subset of predictors that is then considered as potential splitting criterion (for the phone this is like that not everyone has the same decision criteria). Annotation: While building a decision tree (random forests consist of many decision trees), one splits the data at some point according to their features. For example if you have females and males, big and small people in a crowd, you con split this crowd by gender and then by size or by size and then by gender to build a decision tree.\n\nApplying the random forest follows the same principle as for the methods before: We visualize the data (we have already done this so often for the airquality data set, thus we skip it here), fit the algorithm and then plot the outcomes.\nFit a random forest and visualize the predictions:\n\nlibrary(randomForest)\nset.seed(123)\n\ndata = airquality[complete.cases(airquality),]\n\nrf = randomForest(Ozone~., data = data)\npred = predict(rf, data)\nplot(Ozone~Temp, data = data)\nlines(data$Temp[order(data$Temp)], pred[order(data$Temp)], col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne advantage of random forests is that we will get an importance of variables. At each split in each tree, the improvement in the split-criterion is the importance measure attributed to the splitting variable, and is accumulated over all the trees in the forest separately for each variable. Thus the variable importance shows us how important a variable is averaged over all trees.\n\nrf$importance\n\n        IncNodePurity\nSolar.R      17969.59\nWind         31978.36\nTemp         34176.71\nMonth        10753.73\nDay          15436.47\n\n\nThere are several important hyperparameters in a random forest that we can tune to get better results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHyperparameter\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nmtry\nSubset of features randomly selected in each node (from which the algorithm can select the feature that will be used to split the data).\n\n\nminimum node size\nMinimal number of observations allowed in a node (before the branching is canceled)\n\n\nmax depth\nMaximum number of tree depth",

    "text": "5.3 Boosted Regression Trees\nRandom forests fit hundreds of trees independent of each other. Here, the idea of a boosted regression tree comes in. Maybe we could learn from the errors the previous weak learners made and thus enhance the performance of the algorithm.\nA boosted regression tree (BRT) starts with a simple regression tree (weak learner) and then sequentially fits additional trees to improve the results. There are two different strategies to do so:\n\nAdaBoost: Wrong classified observations (by the previous tree) will get a higher weight and therefore the next trees will focus on difficult/missclassified observations.\nGradient boosting (state of the art): Each sequential model will be fit on the residual errors of the previous model (strongly simplified, the actual algorithm is very complex).\n\nWe can fit a boosted regression tree using xgboost, but before we have to transform the data into a xgb.Dmatrix (which is a xgboost specific data type, the package sadly doesn’t support R matrices or data.frames).\n\nlibrary(xgboost)\nset.seed(123)\n\ndata = airquality[complete.cases(airquality),]\n\n\ndata_xg = xgb.DMatrix(data = as.matrix(scale(data[,-1])), label = data$Ozone)\nbrt = xgboost(data_xg, nrounds = 16L)\n\n[1] train-rmse:39.724624 \n[2] train-rmse:30.225761 \n[3] train-rmse:23.134840 \n[4] train-rmse:17.899179 \n[5] train-rmse:14.097785 \n[6] train-rmse:11.375457 \n[7] train-rmse:9.391276 \n[8] train-rmse:7.889690 \n[9] train-rmse:6.646586 \n[10]    train-rmse:5.804859 \n[11]    train-rmse:5.128437 \n[12]    train-rmse:4.456416 \n[13]    train-rmse:4.069464 \n[14]    train-rmse:3.674615 \n[15]    train-rmse:3.424578 \n[16]    train-rmse:3.191301 \n\n\nThe parameter “nrounds” controls how many sequential trees we fit, in our example this was 16. When we predict on new data, we can limit the number of trees used to prevent overfitting (remember: each new tree tries to improve the predictions of the previous trees).\nLet us visualize the predictions for different numbers of trees:\n\noldpar = par(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nfor(i in 1:4){\n  pred = predict(brt, newdata = data_xg, ntreelimit = i)\n  plot(data$Temp, data$Ozone, main = i)\n  lines(data$Temp[order(data$Temp)], pred[order(data$Temp)], col = \"red\")\n}\n\n[15:45:43] WARNING: src/c_api/c_api.cc:935: `ntree_limit` is deprecated, use `iteration_range` instead.\n\n\n[15:45:43] WARNING: src/c_api/c_api.cc:935: `ntree_limit` is deprecated, use `iteration_range` instead.\n\n\n[15:45:43] WARNING: src/c_api/c_api.cc:935: `ntree_limit` is deprecated, use `iteration_range` instead.\n\n\n[15:45:43] WARNING: src/c_api/c_api.cc:935: `ntree_limit` is deprecated, use `iteration_range` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(oldpar)\n\nThere are also other ways to control for complexity of the boosted regression tree algorithm:\n\nmax_depth: Maximum depth of each tree.\nshrinkage (each tree will get a weight and the weight will decrease with the number of trees).\n\nWhen having specified the final model, we can obtain the importance of the variables like for random forests:\n\nxgboost::xgb.importance(model = brt)\n\n   Feature        Gain     Cover  Frequency\n    &lt;char&gt;       &lt;num&gt;     &lt;num&gt;      &lt;num&gt;\n1:    Temp 0.570072012 0.2958229 0.24836601\n2:    Wind 0.348230653 0.3419576 0.24183007\n3: Solar.R 0.058795502 0.1571072 0.30718954\n4:     Day 0.019529985 0.1779925 0.16993464\n5:   Month 0.003371847 0.0271197 0.03267974\n\nsqrt(mean((data$Ozone - pred)^2)) # RMSE\n\n[1] 17.89918\n\ndata_xg = xgb.DMatrix(data = as.matrix(scale(data[,-1])), label = data$Ozone)\n\nOne important strength of xgboost is that we can directly do a cross-validation (which is independent of the boosted regression tree itself!) and specify its properties with the parameter “n-fold”:\n\nset.seed(123)\n\nbrt = xgboost(data_xg, nrounds = 5L)\n\n[1] train-rmse:39.724624 \n[2] train-rmse:30.225761 \n[3] train-rmse:23.134840 \n[4] train-rmse:17.899179 \n[5] train-rmse:14.097785 \n\nbrt_cv = xgboost::xgb.cv(data = data_xg, nfold = 3L,\n                         nrounds = 3L, nthreads = 4L)\n\n[1] train-rmse:39.895106+2.127355   test-rmse:40.685477+5.745327 \n[2] train-rmse:30.367660+1.728788   test-rmse:32.255812+5.572963 \n[3] train-rmse:23.446237+1.366757   test-rmse:27.282435+5.746244 \n\nprint(brt_cv)\n\n##### xgb.cv 3-folds\n  iter train_rmse_mean train_rmse_std test_rmse_mean test_rmse_std\n &lt;num&gt;           &lt;num&gt;          &lt;num&gt;          &lt;num&gt;         &lt;num&gt;\n     1        39.89511       2.127355       40.68548      5.745327\n     2        30.36766       1.728788       32.25581      5.572963\n     3        23.44624       1.366757       27.28244      5.746244\n\n\nAnnotation: The original data set is randomly partitioned into \\(n\\) equal sized subsamples. Each time, the model is trained on \\(n - 1\\) subsets (training set) and tested on the left out set (test set) to judge the performance.\nIf we do three-folded cross-validation, we actually fit three different boosted regression tree models (xgboost models) on \\(\\approx 67\\%\\) of the data points.

    "text": "6.1 K-Nearest-Neighbor\nIn this chapter, we introduce support-vector machines (SVMs) and other distance-based methods Hint: Distance-based models need scaling!\nK-nearest-neighbor (kNN) is a simple algorithm that stores all the available cases and classifies the new data based on a similarity measure. It is mostly used to classify a data point based on how its \\(k\\) nearest neighbors are classified.\nLet us first see an example:\nx = scale(iris[,1:4])\ny = iris[,5]\nplot(x[-100,1], x[-100, 3], col = y)\npoints(x[100,1], x[100, 3], col = \"blue\", pch = 18, cex = 1.3)\nWhich class would you decide for the blue point? What are the classes of the nearest points? Well, this procedure is used by the k-nearest-neighbors classifier and thus there is actually no “real” learning in a k-nearest-neighbors classification.\nFor applying a k-nearest-neighbors classification, we first have to scale the data set, because we deal with distances and want the same influence of all predictors. Imagine one variable has values from -10.000 to 10.000 and another from -1 to 1. Then the influence of the first variable on the distance to the other points is much stronger than the influence of the second variable. On the iris data set, we have to split the data into training and test set on our own.

To do so, a support-vector machine fits the parameters of a hyperplane (a \\(n-1\\) dimensional subspace in a \\(n\\)-dimensional space) in the predictor space by optimizing the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest point from each class.\nFitting a support-vector machine:\n\nlibrary(e1071)\n\ndata = iris\ndata[,1:4] = apply(data[,1:4], 2, scale)\nindices = sample.int(nrow(data), 0.7*nrow(data))\ntrain = data[indices,]\ntest = data[-indices,]\n\nsm = svm(Species~., data = train, kernel = \"linear\")\npred = predict(sm, newdata = test)\n\n\noldpar = par(mfrow = c(1, 2))\nplot(test$Sepal.Length, test$Petal.Length,\n     col =  pred, main = \"predicted\")\nplot(test$Sepal.Length, test$Petal.Length,\n     col =  test$Species, main = \"observed\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(oldpar)\n\nmean(pred == test$Species) # Accuracy.\n\n[1] 0.9777778\n\n\nSupport-vector machines can only work on linearly separable problems. (A problem is called linearly separable if there exists at least one line in the plane with all of the points of one class on one side of the hyperplane and all the points of the others classes on the other side).\nIf this is not possible, we however, can use the so called kernel trick, which maps the predictor space into a (higher dimensional) space in which the problem is linear separable. After having identified the boundaries in the higher-dimensional space, we can project them back into the original dimensions.\n\nx1 = seq(-3, 3, length.out = 100)\nx2 = seq(-3, 3, length.out = 100)\nX = expand.grid(x1, x2)\ny = apply(X, 1, function(t) exp(-t[1]^2 - t[2]^2))\ny = ifelse(1/(1+exp(-y)) &lt; 0.62, 0, 1)\n\nimage(matrix(y, 100, 100))\nanimation::saveGIF(\n  {\n    for(i in c(\"truth\", \"linear\", \"radial\", \"sigmoid\")){\n      if(i == \"truth\"){\n        image(matrix(y, 100,100),\n        main = \"Ground truth\", axes = FALSE, las = 2)\n      }else{\n        sv = e1071::svm(x = x, y = factor(y), kernel = i)\n        image(matrix(as.numeric(as.character(predict(sv, x))), 100, 100),\n        main = paste0(\"Kernel: \", i), axes = FALSE, las = 2)\n        axis(1, at = seq(0,1, length.out = 10),\n        labels = round(seq(-3, 3, length.out = 10), 1))\n        axis(2, at = seq(0,1, length.out = 10),\n        labels = round(seq(-3, 3, length.out = 10), 1), las = 2)\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  movie.name = \"svm.gif\", autobrowse = FALSE, interval = 2\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you have seen, this does not work with every kernel.

    "text": "6.3 Clustering methods\nIn unsupervised learning, we want to identify patterns in data without having any examples (supervision) about what the correct patterns / classes are. As an example, consider the iris data set. Here, we have 150 observations of 4 floral traits:\n\niris = datasets::iris\ncolors = hcl.colors(3)\ntraits = as.matrix(iris[,1:4])\nspecies = iris$Species\nimage(y = 1:4, x = 1:length(species) , z = traits,\n      ylab = \"Floral trait\", xlab = \"Individual\")\nsegments(50.5, 0, 50.5, 5, col = \"black\", lwd = 2)\nsegments(100.5, 0, 100.5, 5, col = \"black\", lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\nTrait distributions of iris dataset\n\n\n\n\nThe observations are from 3 species and indeed those species tend to have different traits, meaning that the observations form 3 clusters.\n\npairs(traits, pch = as.integer(species), col = colors[as.integer(species)])\n\n\n\n\nScatterplots for trait-trait combinations.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, imagine we don’t know what species are, what is basically the situation in which people in the antique have been. The people just noted that some plants have different flowers than others, and decided to give them different names. This kind of process is what unsupervised learning does.\n\n6.3.1 Hierarchical Clustering\nA cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.\nIn hierarchical clustering, a hierarchy (tree) between data points is built.\n\nAgglomerative: Start with each data point in their own cluster, merge them up hierarchically.\nDivisive: Start with all data points in one cluster, and split hierarchically.\n\nMerges / splits are done according to linkage criterion, which measures distance between (potential) clusters. Cut the tree at a certain height to get clusters.\nHere an example\n\nset.seed(123)\n\n#Reminder: traits = as.matrix(iris[,1:4]).\n\nd = dist(traits)\nhc = hclust(d, method = \"complete\")\n\nplot(hc, main=\"\")\nrect.hclust(hc, k = 3)  # Draw rectangles around the branches.\n\n\n\n\nResults of hierarchical clustering.

However, as we will learn later, optimizing the method without a hold-out for testing implies that our model may be overfitting. We should check this using cross-validation.\n\n\n6.3.2 K-means Clustering\nAnother example for an unsupervised learning algorithm is k-means clustering, one of the simplest and most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.\nTo start with the algorithm, you first have to specify the number of clusters (for our example the number of species). Each cluster has a centroid, which is the assumed or real location representing the center of the cluster (for our example this would be how an average plant of a specific species would look like). The algorithm starts by randomly putting centroids somewhere. Afterwards each data point is assigned to the respective cluster that raises the overall in-cluster sum of squares (variance) related to the distance to the centroid least of all. After the algorithm has placed all data points into a cluster the centroids get updated. By iterating this procedure until the assignment doesn’t change any longer, the algorithm can find the (locally) optimal centroids and the data points belonging to this cluster. Note that results might differ according to the initial positions of the centroids. Thus several (locally) optimal solutions might be found.\nThe “k” in K-means refers to the number of clusters and the ‘means’ refers to averaging the data-points to find the centroids.\nA typical pipeline for using k-means clustering looks the same as for other algorithms. After having visualized the data, we fit a model, visualize the results and have a look at the performance by use of the confusion matrix. By setting a fixed seed, we can ensure that results are reproducible.\n\nset.seed(123)\n\n#Reminder: traits = as.matrix(iris[,1:4]).\n\nkc = kmeans(traits, 3)\nprint(kc)\n\nK-means clustering with 3 clusters of sizes 50, 62, 38\n\nCluster means:\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\n1     5.006000    3.428000     1.462000    0.246000\n2     5.901613    2.748387     4.393548    1.433871\n3     6.850000    3.073684     5.742105    2.071053\n\nClustering vector:\n  [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [38] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n [75] 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3\n[112] 3 3 2 2 3 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 3 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 2 3\n[149] 3 2\n\nWithin cluster sum of squares by cluster:\n[1] 15.15100 39.82097 23.87947\n (between_SS / total_SS =  88.4 %)\n\nAvailable components:\n\n[1] \"cluster\"      \"centers\"      \"totss\"        \"withinss\"     \"tot.withinss\"\n[6] \"betweenss\"    \"size\"         \"iter\"         \"ifault\"      \n\n\nVisualizing the results.

In ML algorithms, these different tasks can be represented by different loss functions. Moreover, the tasks can differ even within regression or classification (e.g., in classification, we have binary classification (0 or 1) or multi-class classification (0, 1, or 2)).

We have a few important hyperparameters that affect only the optimization:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHyperparameter\nMeaning\nRange\n\n\n\n\nlearning rate\nthe step size of the parameter updating in the iterative optimization routine, if too high, the optimizer will step over good local optima, if too small, the optimizer will be stuck in a bad local optima\n[0.00001, 0.5]\n\n\nbatch size\nNNs are optimized via stochastic gradient descent, i.e. only a batch of the data is used to update the parameters at a time\nDepends on the data:\n10-250\n\n\nepoch\nthe data is fed into the optimization in batches, once the entire data set has been used in the optimization, the epoch is complete (so e.g. n = 100, batch size = 20, it takes 5 steps to complete an epoch)\n100+ (use early stopping)\n\n\n\n\n7.3.1 Learning rate\ncito visualizes the training (see graphic). The reason for this is that the training can easily fail if the learning rate (lr) is poorly chosen. If the lr is too high, the optimizer “jumps” over good local optima, while it gets stuck in local optima if the lr is too small:\n\nmodel = dnn(Ozone~., \n            hidden = c(10L, 10L), \n            activation = c(\"selu\", \"selu\"), \n            loss = \"mse\", lr = 0.4, data = data, epochs = 150L, verbose = FALSE)\n\nIf too high, the training will either directly fail (because the loss jumps to infinity) or the loss will be very wiggly and doesn’t decrease over the number of epochs.\n\nmodel = dnn(Ozone~., \n            hidden = c(10L, 10L), \n            activation = c(\"selu\", \"selu\"), \n            loss = \"mse\", lr = 0.0001, data = data, epochs = 150L, verbose = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf too low, the loss will be very wiggly but doesn’t decrease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning rate scheduler\n\n\n\nAdjusting / reducing the learning rate during training is a common approach in neural networks. The idea is to start with a larger learning rate and then steadily decrease it during training (either systematically or based on specific properties):\n\nmodel = dnn(Ozone~., \n            hidden = c(10L, 10L), \n            activation = c(\"selu\", \"selu\"), \n            loss = \"mse\", \n            lr = 0.1,\n            lr_scheduler = config_lr_scheduler(\"step\", step_size = 30, gamma = 0.1),\n            # reduce learning all 30 epochs (new lr = 0.1* old lr)\n            data = data, epochs = 150L, verbose = FALSE)",

    "text": "7.4 Architecture\nThe architecture of the NN can be specified by the hidden argument, it is a vector where the length corresponds to the number of hidden layers and value of entry to the number of hidden neurons in each layer (and the same applies for the activation argument that specifies the activation functions in the hidden layers).

    "text": "8.1 A Practical Example\nThe goal of explainable AI (xAI, aka interpretable machine learning) is to explain why a fitted machine learning model makes certain predictions. A typical example is to understand how important different variables are for predictions. The incentives for doing so range from a better technical understanding of the models over understanding which data is important for improving predictions to questions of fairness and discrimination (e.g. to understand if an algorithm uses skin color to make a decision).\nIn this lecture we will work with an African Elephant occurrence dataset.\nWe will fit a random forest and use the iml package for xAI, see https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/.\nlibrary(iml)\nlibrary(ranger) # different random Forest package!\nlibrary(EcoData)\nlibrary(cito)\nset.seed(123)\n\n\ndata = EcoData::elephant$occurenceData\nhead(data)\n?EcoData::elephant\nMeaning of the bioclim variables:\nrf = ranger(as.factor(Presence) ~ ., data = data, probability = TRUE)\nThe cito package has quite extensive xAI functionalities. However, ranger, as most other machine learning packages, has no extensive xAI functionalities. Thus, to do xAI with ranger, we have to use a generic xAI package that can handle almost all machine learning models.\nWhen we want to use such a generic package, we first have to create a predictor object, that holds the model and the data. The iml package uses R6 classes, that means new objects can be created by calling Predictor$new(). (Do not worry if you do not know what R6 classes are, just use the command.)\nWe often have to warp our predict function inside a so called wrapper function so that the output of the predict function fits to iml (iml expects that the predict function returns a vector of predictions:\npredict_wrapper = function(model, newdata) predict(model, data=newdata)$predictions[,2]\n\npredictor = Predictor$new(rf, data = data[,-1], y = data[,1], predict.function = predict_wrapper)\npredictor$task = \"classif\" # set task to classification\n# \"Predictor\" is an object generator.",

    "text": "9.1 Causal Inference on Static Data\nxAI aims at explaining how predictions are being made. In general, xAI != causality. xAI methods measure which variables are used for predictions by the algorithm, or how far variables improve predictions. The important point to note here: If a variable causes something, we could also expect that it helps predicting the very thing. The opposite, however, is not generally true - very often it is possible that a variable that doesn’t cause anything can predict something.\nIn statistics courses (in particular our course: Advanced Biostatistics), we discuss the issue of causality at full length. Here, we don’t want to go into the details, but again, you should in general resist to interpret indicators of importance in xAI as causal effects. They tell you something about what’s going on in the algorithm, not about what’s going on in reality.\nMethods for causal inference depend on whether we have dynamic or static data. The latter is the more common case. With static data, the problem is confounding. If you have several correlated predictors, you can get spurious correlations between a given predictor and the response, although there is no causal effect in general.\nMultiple regression and few other methods are able to correct for other predictors and thus isolate the causal effect. The same is not necessarily true for machine learning algorithms and xAI methods. This is not a bug, but a feature - for making good predictions, it is often no problem, but rather an advantage to also use non-causal predictors.\nHere an example for the indicators of variable importance in the random forest algorithm. The purpose of this script is to show that random forest variable importance will split importance values for collinear variables evenly, even if collinearity is low enough so that variables are separable and would be correctly separated by an lm / ANOVA.\nWe first simulate a data set with 2 predictors that are strongly correlated, but only one of them has an effect on the response.\nlibrary(randomForest)\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Simulation parameters.\nn = 1000\ncol = 0.7\n\n# Create collinear predictors.\nx1 = runif(n)\nx2 = col * x1 + (1-col) * runif(n)\n\n# Response is only influenced by x1.\ny = x1 + rnorm(n)\nlm / anova correctly identify \\(x1\\) as causal variable.\nsummary(lm(y ~ x1 + x2))\nFit random forest and show variable importance:\nset.seed(123)\n\nfit = randomForest(y ~ x1 + x2, importance = TRUE)\nvarImpPlot(fit)\nVariable importance is now split nearly evenly.\nTask: understand why this is - remember:",

    "section": "9.2 Structural Equation Models",
    "text": "9.2 Structural Equation Models\nIf causal relationships get more complicated, it will not be possible to adjust correctly with a simple lm. In this case, in statistics, we will usually use structural equation models (SEMs). Structural equation models are designed to estimate entire causal diagrams. There are two main SEM packages in R: For anything that is non-normal, you will currently have to estimate the directed acyclic graph (that depicts causal relations) piece-wise with CRAN package piecewiseSEM. Example for a vegetation data set:\n\nlibrary(piecewiseSEM)\n\nmod = psem(\n lm(rich ~ distance + elev + abiotic + age + hetero + firesev + cover,\n    data = keeley),\n lm(firesev ~ elev + age + cover, data = keeley),\n lm(cover ~ age + elev + hetero + abiotic, data = keeley)\n)\nsummary(mod)\nplot(mod)\n\nFor linear structural equation models, we can estimate the entire directed acyclic graph at once. This also allows having unobserved variables in the directed acyclic graph. One of the most popular packages for this is lavaan.\n\nlibrary(lavaan)\n\nmod = \"\n rich ~ distance + elev + abiotic + age + hetero + firesev + cover\n firesev ~ elev + age + cover\n cover ~ age + elev + abiotic\n\"\nfit = sem(mod, data = keeley)\nsummary(fit)\n\nThe default plot options are not so nice as before.\n\nlibrary(lavaanPlot)\n\nlavaanPlot(model = fit)\n\nAnother plotting option is using semPlot.\n\nlibrary(semPlot)\n\nsemPaths(fit)",

    "text": "9.3 Automatic Causal Discovery\nBut how to get the causal graph? In statistics, it is common to “guess” it and afterwards do residual checks, in the same way as we guess the structure of a regression. For more complicated problems, however, this is unsatisfying. Some groups therefore work on so-called causal discovery algorithms, i.e. algorithms that automatically generate causal graphs from data. One of the most classic algorithms of this sort is the PC algorithm. Here an example using the pcalg package:\n\nlibrary(pcalg)\n\nLoading the data:\n\ndata(\"gmG\", package = \"pcalg\") # Loads data sets gmG and gmG8.\nsuffStat = list(C = cor(gmG8$x), n = nrow(gmG8$x))\nvarNames = gmG8$g@nodes\n\nFirst, the skeleton algorithm creates a basic graph without connections (a skeleton of the graph).\n\nskel.gmG8 = skeleton(suffStat, indepTest = gaussCItest,\nlabels = varNames, alpha = 0.01)\nRgraphviz::plot(skel.gmG8@graph)\n\nWhat is missing here is the direction of the errors. The PC algorithm now makes tests for conditional independence, which allows fixing a part (but typically not all) of the directions of the causal arrows.\n\npc.gmG8 = pc(suffStat, indepTest = gaussCItest,\nlabels = varNames, alpha = 0.01)\nRgraphviz::plot(pc.gmG8@graph )",

If you are interested you can have a look here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse variable: “interaction”\nA minimal working example:\n\nLoad data set:\n\n\nlibrary(EcoData)\n\ndata(plantPollinator_df)\nplant_poll = plantPollinator_df\nsummary(plant_poll)\n\n                   crop                       insect          type          \n Vaccinium_corymbosum:  256   Andrena_wilkella   :   80   Length:20480      \n Brassica_napus      :  256   Andrena_barbilabris:   80   Class :character  \n Carum_carvi         :  256   Andrena_cineraria  :   80   Mode  :character  \n Coriandrum_sativum  :  256   Andrena_flavipes   :   80                     \n Daucus_carota       :  256   Andrena_gravida    :   80                     \n Malus_domestica     :  256   Andrena_haemorrhoa :   80                     \n (Other)             :18944   (Other)            :20000                     \n    season             diameter        corolla             colour         \n Length:20480       Min.   :  2.00   Length:20480       Length:20480      \n Class :character   1st Qu.:  5.00   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Median : 19.00   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                    Mean   : 27.03                                        \n                    3rd Qu.: 25.00                                        \n                    Max.   :150.00                                        \n                    NA's   :9472                                          \n    nectar            b.system         s.pollination      inflorescence     \n Length:20480       Length:20480       Length:20480       Length:20480      \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n  composite            guild               tongue            body      \n Length:20480       Length:20480       Min.   : 2.000   Min.   : 2.00  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.: 4.800   1st Qu.: 8.00  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median : 6.600   Median :10.50  \n                                       Mean   : 8.104   Mean   :10.66  \n                                       3rd Qu.:10.500   3rd Qu.:13.00  \n                                       Max.   :26.400   Max.   :25.00  \n                                       NA's   :17040    NA's   :6160   \n  sociality           feeding          interaction \n Length:20480       Length:20480       0   :14095  \n Class :character   Class :character   1   :  595  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   NA's: 5790  \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n\n\n\nImpute missing values (not our response variable!)
