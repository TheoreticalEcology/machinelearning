[["tf.html", "3 Introduction to Tensorflow", " 3 Introduction to Tensorflow TF is a math library which is highly optimized for neural networks If a GPU is available, computations can be easily run on the GPU but even on the CPU is TF still very fast The “backend” (i.e. all the functions and all computations) are written in C++ and CUDA (CUDA is a programming language for the GPU) The interface (the part of TF that we use) is written in python and is also available in R, which means, we can write the code in R/Python but it will be executed by the (compiled) C++ backend.
