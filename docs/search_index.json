For this, the following should work for most people: Run in R: install.packages(&quot;keras&quot;, dependencies = T) keras::install_keras() This should work on most computers, in particular if all software is recent. Sometimes, however, things don’t work well, especially the python distribution often makes problems. If the installation does not work for you, we can look at it together. Also, we will provide some virtual machines in case your computers / laptops are too old or you don’t manage to install TensorFlow. 1.3 Torch for R We may also use Torch for R. This is an R frontend for the popular PyTorch framework. To install Torch, type in R: install.packages(&quot;torch&quot;) library(torch) 1.4 EcoData We may sometimes use datasets from the EcoData package. To install the package, run: devtools::install_github(repo = &quot;florianhartig/EcoData&quot;, subdir = &quot;EcoData&quot;, dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE) 1.5 Further used libraries We will make huge use of different libraries. So take a coffee or 2 and install the following libraries: install.packages(&quot;animation&quot;) install.packages(&quot;ape&quot;) install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) BiocManager::install(c(&quot;Rgraphviz&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;, &quot;RBGL&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;dbscan&quot;) install.packages(&quot;dendextend&quot;) install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;e1071&quot;) install.packages(&quot;factoextra&quot;) install.packages(&quot;glmnet&quot;) install.packages(&quot;gym&quot;) install.packages(&quot;kknn&quot;) install.packages(&quot;iml&quot;) install.packages(&quot;lavaan&quot;) install.packages(&quot;lavaanPlot&quot;) install.packages(&quot;lmtest&quot;) install.packages(&quot;mclust&quot;) install.packages(&quot;missRanger&quot;) install.packages(&quot;mlr3&quot;) install.packages(&quot;mlr3learners&quot;) install.packages(&quot;mlr3measures&quot;) install.packages(&quot;mlr3pipelines&quot;) install.packages(&quot;mlr3tuning&quot;) install.packages(&quot;paradox&quot;) install.packages(&quot;partykit&quot;) install.packages(&quot;pcalg&quot;) install.packages(&quot;piecewiseSEM&quot;) install.packages(&quot;randomForest&quot;) install.packages(&quot;rpart&quot;) install.packages(&quot;rpart.plot&quot;) install.packages(&quot;semPlot&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tfprobability&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) install.packages(&quot;xgboost&quot;) 1.6 Linux/UNIX systems have to fulfill some further dependencies: Debian based systems For Debian based systems, we need: libmagick++-dev build-essential gfortran If you are new to installing packages on Debian, type the following: sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -y libmagick++-dev build-essential gfortran "]]
