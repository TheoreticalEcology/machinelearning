## LM and regularization
L1 = Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)
$$\lambda * \sum_{i = 1}^{p} |W_i| $$
```{r}
plot(density(LaplacesDemon::rlaplace(1e5)), main = "l1")
```



L2 = Ridge 
$$\lambda * \sum_{i = 1}^{p} W_i^2 $$
```{r}
plot(density(rnorm(rnorm(1e5,0,1))), main = "l2")
```
